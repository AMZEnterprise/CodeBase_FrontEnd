We most design URIs(or URLs) in the way that they most not change during years!
Carefully selected directory names are logical and seldom should be changed in the
references in the markup.
Directory names that indicate software mechanisms such as cgi-bin should also be eliminated from URIs.
They might change. Topic names, company sections, access levels, or security levels are also inappropriate for URIs
Remove file extenstions from the URLs and use "Content negotiation" instead.

ex : use the name script or scripts for the directory where you store the script files of a web site instead of php or
javascript, because if you adopt further scripting languages later, the uris in the files of the site will reflect a specific
language rather than a common name. Similarly, the directory name style or styles is more practical than css or xsl,
and the name news or feed is more fortunate than rss or atom. the name images is better than jpg, and a doc or docs
directory can hold a variety of documents from pdf to Word documents, not just a certain type.
