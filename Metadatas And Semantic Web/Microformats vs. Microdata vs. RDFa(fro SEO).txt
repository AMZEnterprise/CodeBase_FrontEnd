You should have noticed that there are similar concepts defined by certain microformats and HTML5 microdata to
describe people, events, or licenses. RDFa, on the other hand, is not limited to such concepts and can be used to
annotate any kind of resource.
As discussed earlier, microformats reuse HTML attributes (for example, class, title) and have separate
vocabularies that are difficult to combine, because microformats do not use the namespace mechanism. Last but not
least, microformats do not define an RDF representation.
HTML5 microdata, as also presented earlier, provides new attributes for HTML5 markup. HTML5 microdata is
easy to write and works well in documents that use a single external vocabulary. Combining different vocabularies
is rather complex in HTML5 microdata. Some vocabulary mappings, such as that of Dublin Core elements, are
supported by the technology by default. A missing feature is the concept of data types and namespaces. Fortunately,
however, HTML5 microdata defines a generic mapping to RDF, so it can be used to express triples.

In contrast to microformats and microdata, RDFa is a complete serialization of RDF and hence provides the most
advanced annotation of them all. RDFa defines new markup attributes and uses URIs and namespaces by default.
Consequently, combining vocabularies is very easy (similar to RDF). RDFa is completely flexible regarding literals and
URI resources
