RDF(Resource Description Framework) is a data representation model, not a language like XML.
On the Semantic Web, there is a variety of structured data, usually expressed in, or based on, the Resource
Description Framework (RDF).

Similar to conventional conceptual modeling
approaches, such as class diagrams and entity relationships, the RDF data model is based on statements that
describe and feature resources, especially web resources, in the form of subject-predicate-object expressions. The
subject corresponds to the resource. The predicate expresses a relationship between the subject and the object. Such
expressions are called triples.
For example, the statement “The grass is green” can be expressed in an RDF triple as follows:
 •  Subject: “The grass”
 •  Predicate: “is”
 •  Object: “green”
