The amount of up-to-date information shared on the Internet is constantly growing. Web syndication provides news
feed channels in order to publish a summary of recently updated web site contents, latest news, or forum posts. These
web feeds make it possible for users to stay informed without browsing web sites. Moreover, the same feed can also be
shared among multiple web sites. Although the two popular web syndication formats, RSS and Atom, have relatively
easy vocabularies, news feed channels are desired to conform to strict standards, first of all XML.
